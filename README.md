Crypto-Example
==============

#### shane tully (shanetully.com)

A short, proof-of-concept RSA and AES encryption program with OpenSSL.

Accompanying documentation and walk-through is available at: https://shanetully.com/2012/06/openssl-rsa-aes-and-c/

## Usage

You must have a recent version of OpenSSL installed before building.

```
$ make
$ ./crypto_example
$ ./crypto_file_example sample.txt
```

## Problems?

Despite going long periods of time without being updated, this repo is actively maintained. Being an example that I don't check often, I rely on users for reports if something breaks. Issues and pull requests are greatly appreciated.
